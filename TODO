# Now

- Support load symbol-file like gdb.
- Some symbols will be optimized out.
- support Qemu
- support multi-thread and make each thread safety, use ptrace(2).
- Add ulpatches that already patched symbols to task symbols.
- Support uninitialized variable yet, see '.bss' 'SHT_NOBITS'
- ULPatch VMA better isn't file map


# Further

- Support static executable ELF (no need to any dynamic libraries).
- Support sign and check.
- Anon vma for each patch and use prctl(2)(CONFIG_ANON_VMA_NAME) set vma's name.
- How to patch to strip ELF process.
- loongarch64 support.

# No support (ideal is plump, reality is bony)

- Maybe we could use dlopen/dlsym to map ulpatch file.
