# ULPatch Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at [https://github.com/Rtoax/ulpatch/issues](https://github.com/Rtoax/ulpatch/issues)

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* If your OS is customized by youself, please list `glibc`, `kernel`, `binutils`, `elfutils`, etc. versions.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

ULPatch could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official ULPatch docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [https://github.com/Rtoax/ulpatch/issues](https://github.com/Rtoax/ulpatch/issues)

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
