## Code Style

Please refer to [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) for the coding style of C language. There may be some differences in specific Linux kernel versions, such as [Linux 4.19](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html), but overall it won't change much.


## VIM Config

The basic configuration of the `.vimrc` file is as follows:

```
set tabstop=8
set softtabstop=8
set shiftwidth=8
# Maybe needed
set cc=80
```
