This document features basic guidelines and recommendations on how to do ulpatch development. Please read it carefully before submitting patches to simplify reviewing and to speed up the merge process.


### Background

In my opinion, if you want to develop and participate in the development of this project together, the following knowledge points need to be understood in advance:

- Linux Basics;
- ELF file format;
- ELF relocation;
- How the Linux kernel runs an ELF executable;
- How the GNU linker works;


### Precautions

You can view unfinished development tasks in [TODO-List](./TODO.md), and you neeto obey the [coding style](./code-style.md) rules.
